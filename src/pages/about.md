Welcome to my blog. I’m David Hermes (Ub1k), a 23-year-old cybersecurity student at the University of Genoa, Italy. Originally from Germany, I also speak fluent Italian and English.

I’m a founding member of [Pwnissa](http://pwnissa.it) the official CTF team of the University of Genoa. My primary area of specialization is binary exploitation, which I am currently studying in depth. This blog is intended as a platform to document and communicate my work in cybersecurity and related themes, while also serving as a means to consolidate and refine my understanding through explanation.
